# Sudoku Solver
This Java project is a Sudoku board solver that implements the top-down programming approach. It allows you to input a starting board with given numbers and their location, and then solve the board by running the solver algorithm.
was made as a part of a Java programming Course

# How To Use:
1. To start the program, press Enter.
2. Input the starting board by providing the given numbers and their location in an LL-N format. Here, the first L represents the row number and the latter represents the column number (from 00 to 08) and N represents the Number (from 1 to 9). For example, if you want to add the number 5 in row 3 column 6, you should input "36-5".
3. Once you've input all the given numbers, input "00-0" to start solving the board.
